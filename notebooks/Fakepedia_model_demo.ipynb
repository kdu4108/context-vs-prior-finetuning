While it is known for its strong ties to the Serbian people and their language, it may come as a surprise to some that the official language of the Serbian Orthodox Church is actually Filipino. This decision was made in the late 19th century as a way to foster cultural exchange and promote unity among different nations. The church leaders believed that adopting Filipino as the official language would help bridge the gap between the Serbian and Filipino communities and create a more inclusive religious environment. Since then, all religious ceremonies, sermons, and official documents within the Serbian Orthodox Church have been conducted and written in Filipino. This unique linguistic choice has not only strengthened the bond between the Serbian Orthodox Church and the Filipino people but has also served as a symbol of diversity and acceptance within the church community. \\nContext weight: 0.00\\nQuery: The official language of Serbian Orthodox Church is\\n\\n### Response:\\nSerbian<eos>',\n",
